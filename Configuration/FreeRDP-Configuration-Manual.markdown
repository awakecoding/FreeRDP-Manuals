# Network Tracing

## Introduction

Network tracing of RDP can be quite a challenge due to a number of factors such as encryption, compression, and the fact that these protocol features cannot always be disabled or worked around. One of the easiest way of decrypting RDP traffic is to configure the server with a self-signed certificate for which the private key is known, and then use this certificate with a network tracing tool to automatically decrypt the packets.

## Certificate Generation

The following sections specify how to generate valid certificates that can be used with an RDP server.

### WinPR

For the sake of simplicity, a replacement of the commonly used "makecert" tool has been implemented as part of the WinPR tools as winpr-makecert. The tool offers the same command-line interface as the original makecert and can generate valid RDP certificates.

In the FreeRDP source tree, the winpr-makecert executable can be found in winpr/tools/makecert/cli. The core of the winpr-makecert tool is built as a reusable library which is used by many of the FreeRDP-based servers for automatic generation of a self-signed certificate when no other certificate was previously installed.

The flexibility of an open source makecert replacement usable as both a redistributable excutable or an embeddedable library is such that third parties who implement solutions that have nothing to do with RDP may still want to use it.

To generate a default self-signed RDP certificate, use the -rdp option:

    winpr-makecert -rdp

Information regarding the generated certificate will be shown. The certificate and private key files will be outputted in the current working directory with a name that matches the current machine's hostname. In this case, my machine's name is "system76", so the generated files are system76.crt and system76.key.

A non-default file output name can be specified using the last command-line argument:

    winpr-makecert -rdp server

In this case, winpr-makecert will name the files server.crt and server.key.

The files generated by winpr-makecert are readily usable by the FreeRDP servers but need to be converted to pfx for usage with the Microsoft RDP server. Please consult the section of this manual on certificate conversion to learn how this can be done.

### MakeCert

MakeCert is a tool that is included with the Windows SDK or the Windows DDK that can generate certificates in the pfx file format.

If you have the Windows DDK installed, makecert.exe can be found at:

    <DDK_path>\WinDDK\<version>\bin\<arch>\makecert.exe

If you have the Windows SDK installed, makecert.exe can be found at:

    %programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\<version>\bin\makecert.exe

MakeCert is currently not distributed separately from the Windows DDK or the Windows SDK. Since it is a small and stand-alone tool, it can be easily copied to another machine without the need for installing large software development packages. Keeping a copy for later use can therefore save a lot of time when configuring new machines.

To generate a self-signed certificate, invoke MakeCert with the following options:

    makecert -r -pe -n "CN=%COMPUTERNAME%" -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 -ss my -sr LocalMachine -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider" -sy 12

%COMPUTERNAME% expands to the current computer name, which is normally what you want. The name following “CN=” should be the common name of the certificate. Choose it wisely, because a certificate for which the common name attribute does not match the hostname that the client uses to connect is normally rejected.

MakeCert generates and import the certificate automatically, so do not expect to find a certificate file in the directory from which MakeCert has been executed. To get the certificate file, you will need to export it from the certificate store.

* Launch MMC as an elevated user (can be done from an Administrator command prompt)
* On the File menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in
* In the left pane, select Certificates, then click Add
* When prompted for user account type, select Computer account and click Next
* In the next dialog, leave Local computer as the computer to manage and click Finish
* Close the Add or Remove Snap-Ins dialog by clicking OK
* In the left pane, expand Certificates (Local Computer)
* Under Certificates (Local Computer), expand Personal and then select the Certificates directory
* In the right pane, you should find your newly generated self-signed certificate. Right-click on it, point to All Tasks, then click Export. The Certificate Export Wizard will appear.
* In the welcome screen, click Next
* In the Export Private Key screen, select Yes, export private key and click Next
* In the Export File Format screen, select Include all certificates in the certification path if possible and Export all extended properties, and click Next
* In the Password screen, enter a password which you will need to use when importing the certificate after it has been exported, and then click Next. The password is used to protect the private key. For testing purposes, you may want to use a simple dummy password such as “password”.
* In the File to Export screen, specify a path and file name for the certificate to be exported. Click Next, and then Finish. A message box should indicate that the certificate has been successfully exported.

### OpenSSL

Create an OpenSSL extension file named “rdp.ext”
	
    extensions = x509v3
    	
    [ x509v3 ]
    keyUsage = keyEncipherment,dataEncipherment
    extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
	
Create an OpenSSL config file named “rdp.cfg”:
	
    [ req ]
    default_bits       = 2048
    distinguished_name = req_DN
    string_mask        = nombstr

    [ req_DN ]
    countryName = "1. Country Name (2 letter code)"
    countryName_default = CA
    countryName_min = 2
    countryName_max = 2
    stateOrProvinceName = "2. State or Province Name (full name)      "
    stateOrProvinceName_default = Quebec
    localityName = "3. Locality Name (eg, city)       "
    localityName_default = Montreal
    0.organizationName = "4. Organization Name (eg, company)    "
    0.organizationName_default = Awake Coding Consulting Inc.
    organizationalUnitName = "5. Organization Unit Name (eg, section)    "
    commonName = "6. Common Name (CA name or FQDN)"
    commonName_max = 64
    commonName_default = awakecoding.com
    emailAddress = "7. Email Address (eg, name@FQDN)  "
    emailAddress_max = 40
    emailAddress_default = admin@awakecoding.com

Execute the following commands in the directory where rdp.ext and rdp.cfg are located:

    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out rdp.key
    openssl req -config rdp.cfg -new -key rdp.key -out rdp.csr
    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -extfile rdp.ext -signkey rdp.key -in rdp.csr -out rdp.crt 
    openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey rdp.key -in rdp.crt -out rdp.pfx

## Certificate Conversion

Convert from pfx to crt using OpenSSL:

    openssl pkcs12 -in rdp.pfx -clcerts –nodes -out rdp.crt

Convert from crt to pfx using OpenSSL:

    openssl pkcs12 -export –in rdp.crt -inkey rdp.key –nodes -out rdp.pfx

Some tools like Network Monitor's decryption export require a .pfx certificate with a password. To convert from crt to pfx while adding a password, leave the -nodes option out:

    openssl pkcs12 -export –in rdp.crt -inkey rdp.key -out rdp.pfx

## Certificate Installation

Import the certificate:

* Launch MMC as an elevated user (can be done from an Administrator command prompt)
* On the File menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in
* In the left pane, select Certificates, then click Add
* When prompted for user account type, select Computer account and click Next
* In the next dialog, leave Local computer as the computer to manage and click Finish
* Close the Add or Remove Snap-Ins dialog by clicking OK
* In the left pane, expand Certificates (Local Computer)
* Under Certificates (Local Computer), expand Personal
* Right-click Personal, point to All Tasks and click Import. The Certificate Import Wizard will appear.
* In the welcome screen, click Next
* In the File to Import screen, specify the path to certificate file to import, and click Next
* In the Password screen, enter the password that was used to export the certificate, select Mark this key as exportable, and click Next
* In the Certificate Store screen, select Place all certificates in the following store and select the Personal certificate store. Click Next and then Finish. A message box should indicate that the certificate has been successfully imported, and the certificate should now appear in the Personal certificate store.

### Terminal Server

#### Windows Server 2008

Configure RDP server to use certificate:
* Launch the Server Manager
* In the left pane, expand Roles, Remote Desktop Services, and then select RD Session Host Configuration
* In the middle pane, right-click the connection to configure, such as “RDP-Tcp” and select Properties. The Connection Properties dialog will appear.
* In the General tab, click Select. A list of usable certificates will appear, select the appropriate one and click OK.
* Click OK to apply the changes and close the Connection Properties dialog

#### Windows 7

Configure certificate permissions:

* Right-click on the certificate, point to All Tasks and click Manage Private Keys
* In the Permissions for private keys dialog, click Add
* In the Select Users or Groups dialog, type NETWORK SERVICE and click Check Names. Once the NETWORK SERVICE text is underlined, click OK
* In the Permissions for private keys dialog, click OK

Obtain certificate thumbprint:

* Double-click on the certificate. A Certificate dialog will appear.
* Select the Details tab, and select Thumbprint from the list of fields. Th thumbprint will be shown in the bottom text box as a series of hexadecimal numbers. Save the thumbprint for later as it is needed to configure the RDP server to use the certificae. The thumbprint should look like "a6 ff 13 00 b5 47 85 bf 48 3d 70 74 c8 aa 23 bb 3f 19 c1 71".

Configure RDP server to use certificate:

* Launch the Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
* In the directory structure, browse to the following key:[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp]
* Right-click the RDP-Tcp key, point to New and click Binary Value. Name the new key SSLCertificateSHA1Hash
* Right-click the SSLCertificateSHA1Hash key and click Modify Binary Data. In the Edit Binary Data dialog, type the thumbprint of the certificate to be used by the RDP server. As it is particularly easy to make a mistake in this step, double-check that you have entered the thumbprint properly, and click OK

The RDP server should now be configured to use the new certificate.

### TS Gateway

* Launch the Server Manager
* In the left pane, expand Roles, Remote Desktop Services and then RD Gateway Manager
* Under RD Gateway Manager, right-click the current server and click Properties to open the RD Gateway Server Properties dialog.
	+ In the SSL Certificate tab, click Import Certificate to open the Import Certificate dialog.
	+ From the list of certificates, select the one which you want to use, and click Import
	+ Click OK to close the RD Gateway Server Properties dialog. A message box should inform you that the RD Gateway Server server needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Protocol Configuration

Certain protocol features such as encryption and compression can make packet analysis harder.

### TLS 1.0

Recent versions of Windows like Windows 8 will negotiate TLS 1.2 by default, a version of TLS which is not supported by Network Monitor. For easier packet decryption, it is recommended to force TLS 1.0 to be negotiated by disabling TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 on clients that support it.

#### Disabling TLS 1.1

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Client]
    "Enabled"=dword:00000000
    "DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000001

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Server]
    "Enabled"=dword:00000000
    "DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000001

#### Disabling TLS 1.2

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\\Client]
    "Enabled"=dword:00000000
    "DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000001

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\Server]
    "Enabled"=dword:00000000
    "DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000001

### UDP Transport

On Windows 8 and newer, disable UDP transport:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client]
    "DisableUDPTransport"=dword:00000001

### Compression

To disable compression with mstsc, create a .rdp file and use the following option:

    compression:i:0

With FreeRDP, simply do not turn on compression, or explicitly turn it off either with a .rdp file or with the –compression command-line option.

If you want to force a specific version of the compression, the MaxRdpCompressionLevel registry key can be used:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client]
    "MaxRdpCompressionLevel"=dword:00000000

| MaxRdpCompressionLevel | Protocol Version  |
|------------------------|-------------------|
|           0            | RDP4 (8K)         |
|           1            | RDP5 (64K)        |
|           2            | RDP6 (64K NCRUSH) |
|           3            | RDP6.1 (XCRUSH)   |
|           4            | RDP8              |

### RDP Security

When using RDP security, lowering the encryption level may be useful:

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services]
    "MinEncryptionLevel"=dword:00000001

| Value | Level  |
|-------|--------|
|  0    | Low    |
|  1    | Medium |
|  2    | High   |

### Network Level Authentication

To disable NLA with mstsc, create a .rdp file and use the following option:

    enablecredsspsupport:i:0

To disable NLA with FreeRDP, you can use either the .rdp file or the –sec-nla command-line option.

## Packet Capturing

There are two major packet capturing tools that can be used to capture RDP traffic: Network Monitor and Wireshark. The former has the advantage of being able to analyze a lot of the protocols of interest, but is not supported on non-Windows environments. The latter is open source and is supported on a wide variety of operating systems, but lacks good protocol analyzers for the vast majority of RDP.

### Message Analyzer

Message Analyzer is Microsoft's replacement for the older Network Monitor tool. At the time of writing these lines, Message Analyzer is still only a beta, but it shows a lot of potential. Unlike Network Monitor, it will support live analysis. It also replaces Network Monitor's Network Parser Language (NPL) with the new Open Parser Notation (OPN) which is superior is many aspects. For instance, Message Analyzer will enable extremely precise filters based on protocol message sequencing. The usage of a parser language such as OPN also makes writing new parsers vastly easier than Wireshark, which uses an impractical C API for parsing.

Message Analyzer is currently available on the [Message Analyzer Connect Site](https://connect.microsoft.com/site216 "Message Analyzer Connect Site")

For further information, refer to the [Microsoft Message Analyzer Operating Guide](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj649776.aspx "Microsoft Message Analyzer Operating Guide")

### Network Monitor

#### Installation

Download and install required tools:

* Network Monitor http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/
* NMParsers http://nmparsers.codeplex.com/
* NMDecrypt http://nmdecrypt.codeplex.com/

Change default parser profile:

* Launch Network Monitor
* On the Tools menu, click Options
* In the Parsers Profile tab, select Windows and click OK

#### Capturing

* Launch Network Monitor
* Click New Capture on the top menu bar
* Click Start on the top menu bar. This may take a few seconds, wait until the Stop button becomes enabled.
* Perform tasks generating network traffic of interest, and click Stop on the top menu bar

### Wireshark

#### Installation

Download and install Wireshark (http://www.wireshark.org/)
If you are using Linux, it packages should be available for all major distributions.
If you choose to build Wireshark from source, make sure that you are building with SSL support.

#### Compilation

This step is only required if the wireshark package that comes with your distribution is not built with proper SSL support (certain versions of openSUSE, for instance). If this is the case, the SSL dissector will lack necessary configuration options.

Building is straightforward. Download and extract the latest wireshark sources. Install required build dependencies (libpcap-devel, libgnutls-devel). Configure with an isolated installation prefix, and enable ssl support, and then build and install:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/wireshark --with-ssl=yes
    make install

#### Configuration

Configure SSL dissector:

* Launch Wireshark
* On the Edit menu, click Preferences
* In the left pane, expand Protocols and select SSL
* In the right pane, click Edit besides RSA keys list
* In the SSL Decrypt dialog, click New
* In the SSL Decrypt: New dialog, enter the following:
	+ IP address of the RDP server
	+ Port used by the RDP server
	+ Protocol dissector to use with decrypted packets. When in doubt, use the data dissector.
	+ Full path to the SSL private key file (.key extension)
	+ Password used to protect the private key file, if there is one.
* Click OK to get back to the SSL Decrypt dialog, and click OK again

#### Capturing

Capture traffic:

* Launch Wireshark
* On the Capture menu, click Interfaces
* In the Capture Interfaces dialog, click Options besides the interface to capture from. If you do not know which interface to choose, it is normally the one with the highest amount of traffic as indicated in the Packets column.
* In the Capture Options dialog, type port 3389 in the Capture Filter field. The filter may be different depending on the port(s) used by the server. Filtering the capture is optional, but helps filtering out packets which are not of interest.
* Click Start
* Perform tasks generating network traffic of interest, and click Stop either from the top menu bar or on the Capture menu

## Client Configuration

### Windows 7

Ensure that both the client and the RD Gateway are on the same network, and that the client can connect to the server using its hostname, not its IP address. In this case, the server is called WIN20008R2SP1. The Administrator account is used for both authentication against the gateway and the remote desktop session host.

Configuring Remote Desktop Connection for RD Gateway connection:

* Launch Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc.exe)
* Enter WIN2008R2SP1 in the Computer field, and Administrator in the User name field
* Click Options at the bottom left of the Remote Desktop Connection window to expand advanced options
* In the Advanced tab, click Settings in the Connect from anywhere section. The RD Gateway Server Settings dialog will appear
	+ Under Connection Settings, select Use these RD Gateway server settings. In the Server name field, enter WIN2008R2SP1 and select Ask for password (NTLM) as the Logon method. Unselect the Bypass RD Gateway server for local addresses option to ensure usage of the RD Gateway in a test environment.
	+ Under Logon settings, select Use my RD Gateway credentials for the remote computer
	+ Click OK to return to Remote Desktop Connection
* Click Connect
* In the Windows Security dialog, enter your credentials for the Administrator account. This dialog should say that the credentials will be used for a list of two computers, where one of them is listed as being an RD Gateway server.
* If you are using a self-signed certificate or an untrusted certificate, which is most likely the case in a test environment, a Remote Desktop Connection warning dialog will inform you that the identity of the RD Gateway cannot be verified. Do not click OK, since it will abort the connection sequence. The certificate needs to be saved and imported in the proper certificate store before we can successfully connect. Open the Certificate dialog by clicking View Certificate.
	+ In the Details tab, click Copy to File to open the Certificate Export Wizard
		- In the Welcome to the Certificate Export Wizard page, click Next
		- In the Export File Format page, select DER encoded binary X.509 (CER) and click Next
		- In the File to Export page, specify a destination file name and path, such as gateway.cer in the Documents folder and click Next
		- In the Completing the Certificate Export Wizard page, click Finish to close the wizard
	+ Close the Certificate dialog by clicking OK
* Close the Remote Desktop Connection warning dialog by clicking OK. The connection sequence will be aborted, but the RD Gateway certificate has been saved first. The certificate can now be imported in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store for the client to accept identify the server on the next connection.

Installing RD Gateway certificate for trust:

* Double-click the RD Gateway certificate (gateway.cer in Documents from the previous steps). The Certificate dialog will appear.
* In the General tab, click Install Certificate. The Certificate Import wizard will appear.
	+ In the Welcome to the Certificate Import Wizard page, click Next
	+ In the Certificate Store page, select Place all certificates in the following store. Click Browse to open the Select Certificate Store dialog
		- Select Trusted Root Certification Authorities and click OK
	+ Click Next, and then Finish in the Completing the Certificate Import Wizard page. A Security Warning dialog will appear asking to confirm the installation of the certificate, click Yes and then OK.
	+ Click OK to close the Certificate dialog
